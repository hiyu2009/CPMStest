# ng2-accordion

Simple accordion control for your angular2 applications using bootstrap3. Does not depend of jquery.
If you don't want to use it without bootstrap - simply create proper css classes. Please star a project if you liked it,
or create an issue if you have problems with it.

## Installation

1. Install npm module:
    
    `npm install ng2-accordion --save`

2. If you are using system.js you may want to add this into `map` and `package` config:

    ```json
    {
        "map": {
            "ng2-accordion": "node_modules/ng2-accordion"
        },
        "packages": {
            "ng2-accordion": { "main": "index.js", "defaultExtension": "js" }
        }
    }
    ```

## Usage

```javascript
<accordion [showArrows]="true" [closeOthers]="false" [expandAll]="true">
    <accordion-group heading="Accordion heading">
        <accordion-heading>
            Or <b>custom</b> <accordion-toggle>heading with clickable zone.</accordion-toggle>
        </accordion-heading>
        Accordion group contents.
    </accordion-group>
    ...
</accordion>
```

* `<accordion>`:

    Contains accordion groups.

    * `[showArrows]="true|false"` Indicates if arrows should be shown or not. Default is **false**
    * `[closeOthers]="true|false"` Indicates if other opened groups should be automatically closed when you open a new group. Default is **true**
    * `[expandAll]="true|false"` Indicates if all panels should be expanded by default. Default is **false**.
    When using this option `closeOthers` is explicitly set to true, because this option does not make sense
    when you can have only one opened panel at the same time.
* `<accordion-group>`:

    Used inside `<accordion>` and represents a single collapsible panel.

    * `heading="Group heading"` Simple text group heading
    * `<accordion-heading>` Content zone where you can put custom headings

* `<accordion-toggle>`:

    Used inside `<accordion-group>` to provide a *custom clickable zone* for the accordion heading.
    This is usable when you have clickable controls in your header (for example checkbox) and you don't want
    accordion to be opened/closed on click of this controls.
